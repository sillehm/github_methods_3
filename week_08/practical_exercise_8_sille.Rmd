REMEMBER: This is Assignment 3 and will be part of your final portfolio   

```{r}
library('reticulate')
```


# EXERCISE 1 - Load the magnetoencephalographic recordings and do some initial plots to understand the data  

The files `megmag_data.npy` and `pas_vector.npy` can be downloaded here (http://laumollerandersen.org/data_methods_3/megmag_data.npy) and here (http://laumollerandersen.org/data_methods_3/pas_vector.npy)   

1) Load `megmag_data.npy` and call it `data` using `np.load`. You can use `join`, which can be imported from `os.path`, to create paths from different string segments  
```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.load('/Users/Sillemarkussen/Desktop/Methods_3/megmag_data.npy')
```

    i. The data is a 3-dimensional array. The first dimension is number of repetitions of a visual stimulus , the second dimension is the number of sensors that record magnetic fields (in Tesla) that stem from neurons activating in the brain, and the third dimension is the number of time samples. How many repetitions, sensors and time samples are there?  
```{python}
data.shape
```
The first dimension consists of 682 repetitions of visual stimulus, the second consists of 102 sensors and the third of 251 time samples. 

    ii. The time range is from (and including) -200 ms to (and including) 800 ms with a sample recorded every 4 ms. At time 0, the visual stimulus was briefly presented. Create a 1-dimensional array called `times` that represents this.
```{python}
times = np.arange(-200, 804, 4) #804 for it to include 800 :)
```
    
    iii. Create the sensor covariance matrix $\Sigma_{XX}$: $$\Sigma_{XX} = \frac 1 N \sum_{i=1}^N XX^T$$ $N$ is the number of repetitions and $X$ has $s$ rows and $t$ columns (sensors and time), thus the shape is $X_{s\times t}$. Do the sensors pick up independent signals? (Use `plt.imshow` to plot the sensor covariance matrix)  
    
```{python}
# Creating an empty matrix which has the size as an sxs matrix
cov_init = np.zeros(shape = (102,102))

# Starting to create the covariance matrix by looping over each of the repetitions 
for i in range(682):
  X = data[i]
  cov_init += X@(np.transpose(X))

# Multiplying the current covariance matrix with 1 over the number of repetitions to complete the formula
cov_var = 1/682*cov_init

# Plotting 
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(cov_var)
plt.colorbar()
plt.title("Sensor covariance matrix")
plt.show()
```
*** SKRIV HER ***
Do the sensors pick up independent signals? ved 50 er der meget covariance 
der er forskellige farver = they do not pick up completely independent signals. Especially ved 50  
  
    iv. Make an average over the repetition dimension using `np.mean` - use the `axis` argument. (The resulting array should have two dimensions with time as the first and magnetic field as the second)  
```{python}

# Array containing the average over axis 0 (repetitions)
average_rep = np.mean(data, axis = 0)

average_rep.shape

```
    
    v. Plot the magnetic field (based on the average) as it evolves over time for each of the sensors (a line for each) (time on the x-axis and magnetic field on the y-axis). Add a horizontal line at $y = 0$ and a vertical line at $x = 0$ using `plt.axvline` and `plt.axhline`  
```{python}

plt.figure()
plt.plot(times, average_rep.T) #T tranposes so that the dimensions match
plt.axvline()
plt.axhline()
plt.title("***")
plt.xlabel()("***")
plt.ylabel("***")
plt.show()

```
    
    vi. Find the maximal magnetic field in the average. Then use `np.argmax` and `np.unravel_index` to find the sensor that has the maximal magnetic field.
```{python}

# Maximal magnetic field in tesla
average_rep.max()

# The sensor that has the maximal magnetic field
# Finding the sensor that has the maximal magnetic field. np.argmax returns a single number from a flat array with all the sensor numbers stacked stacked on top of each other.
ind = np.argmax(average_rep)

# Unraveling the flattened index to find the coordinates for the maximal magnetic field
np.unravel_index(ind, (102,251))

```
The maximal magnetic field is $$2.79e^-13$$ and it is the 73th sensor that has the maximal magnetic field. 

    vii. Plot the magnetic field for each of the repetitions (a line for each) for the sensor that has the maximal magnetic field. Highlight the time point with the maximal magnetic field in the average (as found in 1.1.v) using `plt.axvline`  
```{python}

# Creating an array with each repetition at each time point for sensor number 73
sensor_73 = data[:,73,:]


plt.figure()
plt.plot(times, sensor_73.T) #T transposes so that the dimensions match
plt.axvline(248, color='k', linestyle="--")
plt.axvline()
plt.axhline()
plt.title("***")
plt.xlabel("***")
plt.ylabel("***")
plt.legend()
plt.show()

```
    
    viii. Describe in your own words how the response found in the average is represented in the single repetitions. But do make sure to use the concepts _signal_ and _noise_ and comment on any differences on the range of values on the y-axis  
*** SKRIV HER *** ???
682 repetitions og det er deres samlede værdier lagt sammen 
Range: ikke lige så store negative udsving on the y-axis around the average response at least compared to other 

Signal: the average 
Noise: data from the 73th sensor - a lot of individual differences - not peaking simultaniously - but the average is what we take as the "signal" since it is averagely where people tend to peak ish 
However the signal also include a lot of noise since we loose a lot of information

2) Now load `pas_vector.npy` (call it `y`). PAS is the same as in Assignment 2, describing the clarity of the subjective experience the subject reported after seeing the briefly presented stimulus  
```{python}
y = np.load("pas_vector.npy")
```

    i. Which dimension in the `data` array does it have the same length as?  
```{python}
y.shape
```
The same as the number of repetitions of visual stimulus which is the first dimension of the three dimensional array. 

    ii. Now make four averages (As in Exercise 1.1.iii), one for each PAS rating, and plot the four time courses (one for each PAS rating) for the sensor found in Exercise 1.1.v  
```{python}
# Finding the indices belonging to each pas
pas_1 = np.where(y == 1)
pas_2 = np.where(y == 2)
pas_3 = np.where(y == 3)
pas_4 = np.where(y == 4)

# Finding averages for each pas
average_pas_1 = np.mean(sensor_73[pas_1], axis = 0)
average_pas_2 = np.mean(sensor_73[pas_2], axis = 0)
average_pas_3 = np.mean(sensor_73[pas_3], axis = 0)
average_pas_4 = np.mean(sensor_73[pas_4], axis = 0)

# Plotting 
plt.figure()
plt.plot(times, average_pas_1, color = 'c', label = 'Pas 1') 
plt.plot(times, average_pas_2, color = 'm', label = 'Pas 2')
plt.plot(times, average_pas_3, color = 'y', label = 'Pas 3')
plt.plot(times, average_pas_4, color = 'g', label = 'Pas 4')
plt.legend()
plt.axvline(color = 'k')
plt.axhline(color = 'k')
plt.show()
```
    
    iii. Notice that there are two early peaks (measuring visual activity from the brain), one before 200 ms and one around 250 ms. Describe how the amplitudes of responses are related to the four PAS-scores. Does PAS 2 behave differently than expected?  
*** SKRIV HER *** 
Pas 2 has the highest peak - that is a bit surprising? It would be expected of pas 2 to have a lower peak compared to pas 3 and 4 since it indicates lower rated perceptual awareness 
It makes sense that pas 1

# EXERCISE 2 - Do logistic regression to classify pairs of PAS-ratings  

1) Now, we are going to do Logistic Regression with the aim of classifying the PAS-rating given by the subject  
    i. We'll start with a binary problem - create a new array called `data_1_2` that only contains PAS responses 1 and 2. Similarly, create a `y_1_2` for the target vector  
```{python}
from array import *

# List of indices from pas 1 and 2
pas_1_2 = pas_1[0].tolist() + pas_2[0].tolist()

# Sorting to get the right order
pas_1_2.sort()

# Creating the data array by extracting the indices from data that was rated pas 1 or 2
data_1_2 = data[pas_1_2]

# Creating the target vector
y_1_2 = y[pas_1_2]
```
    
    ii. Scikit-learn expects our observations (`data_1_2`) to be in a 2d-array, which has samples (repetitions) on dimension 1 and features (predictor variables) on dimension 2. Our `data_1_2` is a three-dimensional array. Our strategy will be to collapse our two last dimensions (sensors and time) into one dimension, while keeping the first dimension as it is (repetitions). Use `np.reshape` to create a variable `X_1_2` that fulfils these criteria. 
```{python}
# 
X_1_2 = data_1_2.copy()
X_1_2.shape = X_1_2.shape[0],-1

# Checking the shape
X_1_2.shape
```
    
    iii. Import the `StandardScaler` and scale `X_1_2` 
```{python}
from sklearn.preprocessing import  StandardScaler
```
    
    iv. Do a standard `LogisticRegression` - can be imported from `sklearn.linear_model` - make sure there is no `penalty` applied  
```{python}
# Standardizing 
sc = StandardScaler()
sc.fit(X_1_2)
X_1_2_std = sc.transform(X_1_2)

# Importing LogisticRegression
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression 

# Doing a standard linear regression
logR = LogisticRegression(penalty='none')
logR.fit(X_1_2_std, y_1_2)
```
    
    v. Use the `score` method of `LogisticRegression` to find out how many labels were classified correctly. Are we overfitting? Besides the score, what would make you suspect that we are overfitting?  
```{python}
print(logR.score(X_1_2_std, y_1_2))
```


    vi. Now apply the _L1_ penalty instead - how many of the coefficients (`.coef_`) are non-zero after this? 
```{python}
np.random.seed(7)

logR_L1 = LogisticRegression(penalty='l1', solver='liblinear') 
logR_L1.fit(X_1_2_std, y_1_2)

coef = logR_L1.coef_

coef_non_zero = np.count_nonzero(coef)

print(coef_non_zero)

```

There are 271 non-zero coefficients.

    vii. Create a new reduced $X$ that only includes the non-zero coefficients - show the covariance of the non-zero features (two covariance matrices can be made; $X_{reduced}X_{reduced}^T$ or $X_{reduced}^TX_{reduced}$ (you choose the right one)) . Plot the covariance of the features using `plt.imshow`. Compared to the plot from 1.1.iii, do we see less covariance?  
```{python}
# Creating the reduced X

# Finding the indices for the non-zero coefficients
index_non_zero = np.where(coef != 0)[1]

# Using the indices to find the supset the values from 
X_1_2_nz = X_1_2_std[:,index_non_zero]


# Plotting covariance matrix
covar = (np.transpose(X_1_2_nz))@X_1_2_nz

plt.figure()
plt.imshow(covar)
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```
The covariance of the non-zero features was calculated by $X_{reduced}^TX_{reduced}$ since it there are 271 features.

*** Compared to the plot from 1.1.iii, do we see less covariance?  *** ???

2) Now, we are going to build better (more predictive) models by using cross-validation as an outcome measure    
    i. Import `cross_val_score` and `StratifiedKFold` from `sklearn.model_selection`  
```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, StratifiedKFold

```
    
    ii. To make sure that our training data sets are not biased to one target (PAS) or the other, create `y_1_2_equal`, which should have an equal number of each target. Create a similar `X_1_2_equal`. The function `equalize_targets_binary` in the code chunk associated with Exercise 2.2.ii can be used. Remember to scale `X_1_2_equal`!  
```{python}
# Exercise 2.2.ii
def equalize_targets_binary(data, y):
    np.random.seed(7)
    targets = np.unique(y) ## find the number of targets
    if len(targets) > 2:
        raise NameError("can't have more than two targets")
    counts = list()
    indices = list()
    for target in targets:
        counts.append(np.sum(y == target)) ## find the number of each target
        indices.append(np.where(y == target)[0]) ## find their indices
    min_count = np.min(counts)
    # randomly choose trials
    first_choice = np.random.choice(indices[0], size=min_count, replace=False)
    second_choice = np.random.choice(indices[1], size=min_count,replace=False)
    
    # create the new data sets
    new_indices = np.concatenate((first_choice, second_choice))
    new_y = y[new_indices]
    new_data = data[new_indices, :, :]
    
    return new_data, new_y
```

```{python}
np.random.seed(3)
X_1_2_equal, y_1_2_equal = equalize_targets_binary(data_1_2, y_1_2)

# Copying the three dimensional X_1_2_equal
X_1_2_equal_3d = X_1_2_equal.copy()

# Collapsing the sensor and the time dimensions to be able to scale
X_1_2_equal.shape = X_1_2_equal.shape[0],-1

# Scaling X_1_2_equal
sc = StandardScaler()
sc.fit(X_1_2_equal)
X_1_2_equal_std = sc.transform(X_1_2_equal)
```
  
    iii. Do cross-validation with 5 stratified folds doing standard `LogisticRegression` (See Exercise 2.1.iv)  
```{python}

cv = StratifiedKFold()

logR_5 = LogisticRegression()
scores_5 = cross_val_score(logR_5, X_1_2_equal_std, y_1_2_equal, cv=cv)
print(np.mean(scores_5))
print(scores_5)
```
    
    iv. Do L2-regularisation with the following `Cs=  [1e5, 1e1, 1e-5]`. Use the same kind of cross-validation as in Exercise 2.2.iii. In the best-scoring of these models, how many more/fewer predictions are correct (on average)? 
```{python}
Cs = [1e5, 1e1, 1e-5]

logR_l2_1e5 = LogisticRegression(C=Cs[0])
scores_l2_1e5 = cross_val_score(logR_l2_1e5, X_1_2_equal_std, y_1_2_equal, cv=cv)
print(np.mean(scores_l2_1e5))


logR_l2_1e1 = LogisticRegression(C=Cs[1])
scores_l2_1e1 = cross_val_score(logR_l2_1e1, X_1_2_equal_std, y_1_2_equal, cv=cv)
print(np.mean(scores_l2_1e1))


logR_l2_1e_5 = LogisticRegression(C=Cs[2])
scores_l2_1e_5 = cross_val_score(logR_l2_1e_5, X_1_2_equal_std, y_1_2_equal, cv=cv)
print(np.mean(scores_l2_1e_5))


```
The best scoring model is the one including C=1e-5. It predicts 7% points more correct than the second best. 

```{python}
# Finding the number of correctly predicted instances
(np.mean(scores_l2_1e5))*(len(y_1_2_equal))
(np.mean(scores_l2_1e1))*(len(y_1_2_equal))
(np.mean(scores_l2_1e_5))*(len(y_1_2_equal))
```

The best scoring model is correctly predicting accordingly approximately 12 and 14 instances.

    v. Instead of fitting a model on all `n_sensors * n_samples` features, fit  a logistic regression (same kind as in Exercise 2.2.iv (use the `C` that resulted in the best prediction)) for __each__ time sample and use the same cross-validation as in Exercise 2.2.iii. 
    What are the time points where classification is best? Make a plot with time on the x-axis and classification score on the y-axis with a horizontal line at the chance level (what is the chance level for this analysis?)  

```{python}
# fitting a logistic regression for each time sample
class_scores = []

for i in range(251):
  # scaling data for regression
  dat_l2 = X_1_2_equal[:,:,i]
  dat_l2 = sc.fit_transform(dat_l2)
  
  # regression
  logR_l2 = LogisticRegression(C=1e-5)
  scores = cross_val_score(logR_l2, dat_l2, y_1_2_equal, cv=cv)
  mean = np.mean(scores)
  class_scores.append(mean)
  
```
  
```{python}
# Finding the time points where classification is best
times[class_scores.index(max(class_scores))]
```
  
```{python}
plt.figure()
plt.plot(times, class_scores)
plt.axhline(0.5, color = 'k')
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Classification Score")
plt.show()
```
  *** SKRIV HER *** ??? 780 se plot
  
    vi. Now do the same, but with L1 regression - set `C=1e-1` - what are the time points when classification is best? (make a plot)?  
```{python}
# fitting a logistic regression for each time sample
class_scores_l1 = []

for i in range(251):
  # scaling data for regression
  dat_l1 = X_1_2_equal[:,:,i]
  dat_l1 = sc.fit_transform(dat_l1)
  
  # regression
  logR_l1 = LogisticRegression(penalty='l1', C=1e-1, solver='liblinear')
  scores_l1 = cross_val_score(logR_l1, dat_l1, y_1_2_equal, cv=cv)
  mean_l1 = np.mean(scores_l1)
  class_scores_l1.append(mean_l1)
```
    
```{python}
# Finding the time points where classification is best
times[class_scores_l1.index(max(class_scores_l1))]
```
  
```{python}
# Plotting
plt.figure()
plt.plot(times, class_scores_l1)
plt.axhline(0.5, color = 'k')
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Classification Score")
plt.show()
```
 *** SKRIV HER OGSÅ *** ???   
    
    
    vii. Finally, fit the same models as in Exercise 2.2.vi but now for `data_1_4` and `y_1_4` (create a data set and a target vector that only contains PAS responses 1 and 4). What are the time points when classification is best? Make a plot with time on the x-axis and classification score on the y-axis with a horizontal line at the chance level (what is the chance level for this analysis?)  
```{python}
# Loading data again
data = np.load('megmag_data.npy')

# List of indices from pas 1 and 4
pas_1_4 = pas_1[0].tolist() + pas_4[0].tolist()

# Sorting to get the right order
pas_1_4.sort()

# Creating the data array by extracting the indices from data that was rated pas 1 or 4
data_1_4 = data[pas_1_4]

# Creating the target vector
y_1_4 = y[pas_1_4]

# Equalizing 
X_1_4_equal, y_1_4_equal = equalize_targets_binary(data_1_4, y_1_4)
```

```{python}
# fitting a logistic regression for each time sample
class_scores_1_4 = []

for i in range(251):
  # scaling data for regression
  dat_1_4 = X_1_4_equal[:,:,i]
  dat_1_4 = sc.fit_transform(dat_1_4)
  
  # regression
  logR_1_4 = LogisticRegression(penalty='l1', C=1e-1, solver='liblinear')
  scores_1_4 = cross_val_score(logR_1_4, dat_1_4, y_1_4_equal, cv=cv)
  mean_1_4 = np.mean(scores_1_4)
  class_scores_1_4.append(mean_1_4)

# Finding the time points where classification is best
times[class_scores_1_4.index(max(class_scores_1_4))]

```
    
```{python}
# Plotting
plt.figure()
plt.plot(times, class_scores_1_4)
plt.axhline(0.5, color = 'k')
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Classification Score")
plt.show()
```
    
    
3) Is pairwise classification of subjective experience possible? Any surprises in the classification accuracies, i.e. how does the classification score fore PAS 1 vs 4 compare to the classification score for PAS 1 vs 2?  
```{python}
np.mean(class_scores_1_4)
np.mean(class_scores_l1)

np.max(class_scores_1_4)
np.max(class_scores_l1)
```

*** SKRIV HER *** ???

Is pairwise classification of subjective experience possible? - NO it is at chance level, but maybe some of the time points are better (max) rather than the average (mean of the list)
Any surprises in the classification accuracies? - YES intuitively it should be easier to differentiate pas 1 and 4 than pas 1 and 2.

# EXERCISE 3 - Do a Support Vector Machine Classification on all four PAS-ratings  
1) Do a Support Vector Machine Classification  
    i. First equalize the number of targets using the function associated with each PAS-rating using the function associated with Exercise 3.1.i  
```{python}
def equalize_targets(data, y):
    np.random.seed(7)
    targets = np.unique(y)
    counts = list()
    indices = list()
    for target in targets:
        counts.append(np.sum(y == target))
        indices.append(np.where(y == target)[0])
    min_count = np.min(counts)
    first_choice = np.random.choice(indices[0], size=min_count, replace=False)
    second_choice = np.random.choice(indices[1], size=min_count, replace=False)
    third_choice = np.random.choice(indices[2], size=min_count, replace=False)
    fourth_choice = np.random.choice(indices[3], size=min_count, replace=False)
    
    new_indices = np.concatenate((first_choice, second_choice,
                                 third_choice, fourth_choice))
    new_y = y[new_indices]
    new_data = data[new_indices, :, :]
    
    return new_data, new_y
```

```{python}
# Equalizing data
X_all_pas_equal, y_all_pas_equal = equalize_targets(data, y)
```
    
    ii. Run two classifiers, one with a linear kernel and one with a radial basis (other options should be left at their defaults) - the number of features is the number of sensors multiplied the number of samples. Which one is better predicting the category?
```{python}
# Collapsing the sensor and the time dimensions to be able to scale
X_all_pas_equal_3d = X_all_pas_equal.copy()
X_all_pas_equal_3d.shape = X_all_pas_equal_3d.shape[0],-1

# Scaling equalized data
sc = StandardScaler()
X_all_pas_std = sc.fit_transform(X_all_pas_equal_3d)
```
    
```{python}
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Linear kernel
svm = SVC(kernel='linear')
scores_svm = cross_val_score(svm, X_all_pas_std, y_all_pas_equal, cv=cv)
print(np.mean(scores_svm))

# Radial basis
svm = SVC(kernel='rbf')
scores_svm = cross_val_score(svm, X_all_pas_std, y_all_pas_equal, cv=cv)
print(np.mean(scores_svm))
```
    
    iii. Run the sample-by-sample analysis (similar to Exercise 2.2.v) with the best kernel (from Exercise 3.1.ii). Make a plot with time on the x-axis and classification score on the y-axis with a horizontal line at the chance level (what is the chance level for this analysis?)
```{python}

# fitting a logistic regression for each time sample
class_scores_3_iii = []

for i in range(251):
  # scaling data for regression
  dat_3_iii = X_all_pas_equal[:,:,i]
  dat_3_iii = sc.fit_transform(dat_3_iii)
  
  # regression
  svm = SVC(kernel='rbf')
  scores_svm = cross_val_score(svm, dat_3_iii, y_all_pas_equal, cv=cv)
  mean = np.mean(scores_svm)
  class_scores_3_iii.append(mean)
```
    
```{python}
# Plotting
plt.figure()
plt.plot(times, class_scores_3_iii)
plt.axhline(0.25, color = 'k')
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Classification Score")
plt.show()
```
  
    iv. Is classification of subjective experience possible at around 200-250 ms?  
Looking at the plot it is visible that classification scores are above chance level around 200-250 ms.
```{python}
lower = np.where(times == 200)[0][0]
upper = np.where(times == 248)[0][0]

np.mean(class_scores_3_iii[lower:upper])
```
The average classification score in the interval is 30% - above chance


2) Finally, split the equalized data set (with all four ratings) into a training part and test part, where the test part if 30 % of the trials. Use `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`  
```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_all_pas_std, y_all_pas_equal, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify =y_all_pas_equal)


```

    i. Use the kernel that resulted in the best classification in Exercise 3.1.ii and `fit`the training set and `predict` on the test set. This time your features are the number of sensors multiplied by the number of samples.  
```{python}
svm = SVC(kernel='rbf')
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
predicted = svm.predict(X_test)
```
    
    ii. Create a _confusion matrix_. It is a 4x4 matrix. The row names and the column names are the PAS-scores. There will thus be 16 entries. The PAS1xPAS1 entry will be the number of actual PAS1, $y_{pas1}$ that were predicted as PAS1, $\hat y_{pas1}$. The PAS1xPAS2 entry will be the number of actual PAS1, $y_{pas1}$ that were predicted as PAS2, $\hat y_{pas2}$ and so on for the remaining 14 entries.  Plot the matrix
```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, plot_confusion_matrix

plt.figure()
plot_confusion_matrix(svm, X_test, y_test)
plt.show()
```
 
    iii. Based on the confusion matrix, describe how ratings are misclassified and if that makes sense given that ratings should measure the strength/quality of the subjective experience. Is the classifier biased towards specific ratings?  

true level 3 flest predicted 1 - længere væk i forhold til 1 og 2 eller 2 og 3 agtig 

2 og 4 er bedst
